    <h1>Headings are block level elements</h1>
    <p>Paragraphs are blocks, too. <em>however</em>, &lt;em&gt; and
      &lt;strong&gt; elements are not. They are <strong>inline</strong> elements
      .
    </p>
    <div style="padding-top:1px; border: 1px solid red;">

    </div>
    <p>Block level elements define the flow of the HTML document.
      while the inline elements do not.
    </p>
    <div >
      Button hello and hello Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord
      Chancellor sitting in Lincoln's Inn Hall. Implacable November weather.
       As much mud in the streets as if the waters had but newly retired from
       the face of the earth.
